- Distributes quality levels (30% strong, 40% average, 30% weak)
- Customizes responses based on question content
- Provides realistic analysis based on common educational patterns
- Simulates API delays for realistic UX

## Security & Privacy

### API Key Security
Following industry best practices from [Codefinity](https://codefinity.com/blog/How-to-Secure-and-Use-an-OpenAI-API-Key-for-Your-First-AI-App) and [Medium security guides](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/safeguarding-your-ai-best-practices-for-securing-your-openai-api-key-67e5e585c59a):

- **Session Storage Only**: API keys stored in browser sessionStorage (cleared when browser closes)
- **No Server Transmission**: Keys never sent to our servers - all processing happens in your browser
- **Format Validation**: Validates OpenAI API key format before acceptance
- **Security Warnings**: Clear notifications about key handling best practices
- **Easy Key Management**: Simple buttons to change or clear stored keys

### Privacy Protection
- No data collection or analytics
- No server-side storage of questions or responses
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- API calls go directly from your browser to OpenAI
